            Teamwork is probably the most common word in office culture. It’s thrown in every meeting, seminar and conference but somehow, it still doesn’t get instilled within an organization.
            <br> Why?
            <br> The most probable reason is that teamwork is a process and requires effort from everyone.
            <br> Just because your manager or CEO asked you to show teamwork, it doesn’t mean it will get fostered that easily.
            <br> To begin with, everyone at your organization needs to be on board with the idea of teamwork. If you have colleagues that practice the blame game and don’t realize that everyone is working towards the same goal, then it’s quite unlikely to happen.
            <br> That being said, in this post, we will discuss what is teamwork, its importance and how you can instil it within your team or organization.
            <br> Let’s get cracking!
            <h3>What is teamwork</h3>
            The dictionary describes teamwork as “the combined action of a group, especially when effective and efficient”.
            <br> In business terms, teamwork is when a group of people collaborate to achieve a mutual goal. This means that people within a group use their skills to overcome each other’s weaknesses and achieve a goal which was otherwise not possible.
            <br> Teamwork in business also means setting aside any personal conflicts and coming to a mutual conclusion that not only benefits the group but also the organization.
            <br> It involves constructive feedback and improving each other’s ability without any personal grudges and feuds.
            <h3>What is the importance of teamwork</h3> 
            Now that you know what teamwork means, let’s get into why organizations stress on teamwork so much.
            <br> When it comes to the importance of teamwork, there are more than a few reasons why it’s significant in a company’s growth and success.
            <br> It builds a harmonic relationship between employees, it brings out the best within a team and obviously, the efficiency improves significantly.
            <br> So here are some of the top reasons why teamwork is so important. <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Teamwork unites people</li>
                <li>Teamwork promotes efficiency</li>
                <li>Teamwork fosters a learning environment</li>
                <li>Teamwork offers better opportunities for feedback</li>
                <li>Teamwork helps in resolving issues faster</li>
            </ul>
